# Vending Machine Console App

## Overview
This is a console-based Vending Machine application built during Nagarro's Remote Learning Program, using C# and .NET. The application simulates the basic functionalities of a vending machine, allowing users to browse available products, make purchases, and pay using different payment methods.

## Features
- **Browse Products**: Users can view the list of available products.

  - **Cash Payment**: Users can choose to pay by cash.
  - **Card Payment**: Users can choose to pay by card.
  - **Payment Errors**: The system handles payment errors, such as a "Payment Canceled" error for unsuccessful transactions.
- **Admin Functionality**: An admin can generate various reports:
  - **Sales Report**: Displays the total sales generated by the vending machine.
  - **Volume Report**: Shows the number of products sold.
